        The heat equation is used to describe the distribution of heat in an object over time. While
        not introduced by Fourier, it is a method for solving the equation proposed by Fourier in
        his \textit{Th√©orie analytique de la chaleur}---translated as ``an analytical theory of
        heat''---that we will be investigating. I chose to investigate Fourier's solution to the heat
        equation because it is through his solution that the Fourier Transform, a popular tool in signal
        processing, was defined. I frequently use the Fourier Transform while doing data analysis, and I
        wanted to learn how and why it was created.
