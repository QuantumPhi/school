__IDEOLOGY:__

- Pure Marxism
    - Origins: German philosophy, English political economy, French utopian socialism; Hegel's "dialectics," Smith/Ricardo's labor theory of value, utopian dreams/IR paradox of poverty
    - With dialectics, change/interaction emphasized as essential; Marx materialist
    - Theory of alienation - workers in capitalist society don't own means, sell labor for wage: cut off from productive activity/products made/other humans/creative potential; isolated individual weakened/powerless, goods perpetuate cycle of alienation
    - Theory of value - everything has value in capitalism, so workers only able to acquire part of the value of the goods they make with wages; values equal to amount of labor put in, value added/surplus makes $ for capitalists but lead to overproduction/instability
    - Scale of production/tech necessitate capitalism, but growth restricted by profitability
    - Course of history determined by class struggle, state instrument of wealthy, capitalist ideology masks unfairness of system but revolution inevitable
    - http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/docs/what_is_marxism.php
- Marxism-Leninism `->` declared ideology
    - Develop state into socialist state
    - Leadership of revolutionary vanguard of "professional" revolutionaries: working class faction which came to social consciousness as part of the class struggle
    - Socialist state "dictatorship of the proletariat": democratic centralism/1 party
    - Communist party supreme political institution
    - Final goal is classless society with common ownership/means of production, equality
    - Must STEM research to increase productivity
    - Opponents argue is merely state capitalism, distortion of two ideals to Stalin's benefit
    - https://marxistleninist.wordpress.com/study-guide/
    - It advances scientific arguments in support of the need to destroy capitalism and replace the old production relations of domination and subordination with new social relations of concord and mutual assistance.

TERMS:

- War Communism: a variant of communism implemented by Lenin in response to WWI that gave towns and the Red Army access to weapons and food
- Socialist Federalism: centralized socialism combined with nationalization of industries, etc.

[*Revisionizing Stalin's Russia*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/130291)

- Amount of terror an accurate measure of political/social malleability of population (386)

[*Failing The Stalin Test*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/20031837)

- Most Russians neutral/ambivalent towards Stalin; position unjustified since terrible dictator who killed millions for personal power (2)
- Positive attitudes based on misinformation about Stalin, including concept that he stopped the German advance when in fact it was the work of his generals, who were purged during the war (4)
- Russians have degree of hero-worship; need inspirational figures, can replace Stalin only with mass education, but obstacles such as Putin's gov exist (7-8)

[*The Bolshevik Gamble*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/126892)

- Revolution either product or imposition of previous trends, but reasons for happening unclear (331)
- Four problematic theories of why: proletarian revolution, revolutionary wave, modernizing dictatorship, impossibility of democracy due to Russian traditions (331)
- Problem with proletarian theory of feudalism`->`capitalism`->`classless: Russia industrially backward, short duration of bourgeois regime (332)
- Resolutions: Mensheviks' view of not time for revolution, Trotsky's "theory of permanent revolution" (burden from bourgeois to workers, foreign support) (332)
- Problem with revolutionary wave theory of moderate rev`->`extremist`->`reactionary: no rightist usurpation, failed coup by conservative Kornilov (333)
- Bolsheviks had discipline/determination to hold power in country under transition, systematic modernization undertaken with dictatorial state socialism (334)
- Modernization unrelated to Bolshevik victory: other gov types like Japan just as effective, industrialization done through trial/error (334)
- Truth that Russians fed up with democratic experimentation; however, other gov forms, etc. military dictatorship, would have been just as likely (335)
- Circumstances made Bolshevik success possible but not likely; personal role of Lenin understated (335)
- Lenin powerful, uncompromising, bent on violence; propagandistic/organizational to apply will (335)
- Play upon mood of masses, Bolshevik party's role of transferring Lenin's will to people overstated; mass movement but dull/loose-jointed instrument (336)
- Theory of conspiracy unlikely: Bolshevik Military Org oppose coup, uprising last minute/undermanned, only paralysis of army gave communists chance (337)
- Revolution desperate gamble/unlikely to hold out, Lenin took chance since this slim opportunity was his only chance for personal dictatorship (337-338)
- Victory from RNG: mass grievances from incompetent provisional gov, fear of right paralyze moderates, but followers of Lenin still unwilling to act (338)
- Kerensky's effort to silence Bolshevik press seen as gov assault/provoke desperate holding action, but since army paralyzed/Cossacks refuse to defend, Lenin win by default/come out of hiding (339)
- Unpredictable events cause historical miracle, divergence from present-day govs to communism (340)

[*Stalin and His Era*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/20175118)

- "Stalin played the central role, making all major decisions on the Terror in terms of its initiation, expansion, and ultimate termination" GREAT TERROR (712)
- 1938----Stalin ordered execution of Nikolai Ezhov (chief of secret police/Great Terror organizer) and terminated the purge programs. (713)
- Because research focuses on party/government officials, Great Purge of innocents ignored. More "ordinary people" were killed than officials, numerically. (713)
- Criminals, priests, kulaks, and certain national groups were targeted. However, very blurry even with research----sometimes targets seem "stochastic"/random. (713)
- Official Soviet data: 790,665 and 554,258 people were indicted in the years of 1937 and 1938 for political crimes----353,074 and 328,618 shot. These two years account for 85% of death sentences from 1921 to 1953. (713)
- While the number of people "murdered" by Stalin is much less than that of Hitler, it is potentially greater if the millions who died in the Soviet Gulag and as a result of the Great Famine of 1932-3 are taken into account. (714)
- Soviet Gulag population: 20 million people convicted and some 3 million exiled and deported
- "opposition in the countryside to Stalin was reaching dangerous levels" by 1937, and threats to his rule were magnified by the "release of formely arrested and exiled kulaks". (714)
- *STALIN'S PROMISE (DECLARED IDEOLOGY)*: Promises within his 1936 Constitution for "democratic governance, including multi-candidate Soviet elections". (715)
- Because of onset of war, increased pressure for Stalin to eliminate internal opposition---major factor leading into Great Purge alongside "anxiety and fear". The terror was "defensive, not pro-active". (716)
- Stalin's closest associates---L.M. Kaganovich and V.M. Molotov insisted to the end of their lives that "without the Terror, the country would have lost the war with Nazi Germany." (717)
- *(METHODS TO GAIN POWER)*: many observations made by foreign journalists, interpreters, and diplomats (incl. Winston Churchill and Harry S. Truman) about his human touch in negotiations. It was his peculiar charm that misled some naive Westerns (such as US Pres. FDR) to trust him. (718)
- Stalin became like Tsar. Appropriated Tsarist legacies/symbols e.g. Kremlin, and responded to his mom in 1935 that he was "like a Tsar", and later maintained that the Soviet people needed a Tsar. Adored his cult of personality and the power his positions granted him. (718)
- Some historians view him as a "neo-tsarist Marxist", not only comparing himself to a Tsar but seeking to learn lessons from their rule. (719)
- Stalin re-interpreted Marxism as "creative Marxism", NOT RIGID. Constantly adjusted to new conditions and re-invented and re-interpreted his ideology.(720)

[*Russia and the Bolshevik Revolution*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/127227)

- Bolshevik revolution actually part of a larger revolution, not only the two weeks or so around November 7 (42)
    - arguably began in late 1800s with industrial revolution (42)
    - can be refuted because other countries industrialized quickly without experiencing same revolution (43)
    - collectivism of agriculture in early 1930s through the first five year plan arguably ended the revolution (44)
- October Manifesto of 1905: Tsar Nicholas II established State Duma (assembly with authority to review or qualify government policy) (44)
- February Revolution (also 1917): the new government refused to take total power--refused to dissolve Preparliament and Constituent Assembly because afraid of allowing too much power to one group, which might lead to civil war (44-45)
- Lenin and followers disbanded the Preparliament and Constituent Assembly--they refused to share power with the people--Bolshevik rule was absolute, institutions were privatized (46-47)
- Lenin declared that the Bolshevik controlled Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies was the sole source of government power (46)
- the Bolsheviks assimilated or destroyed all private institutions so that there was no private opposition--bars, unions, religious organizations, etc were all destroyed (47)
- throughout the last part of the 1800s and into the early 1900s censorship laws were relaxed enough to allow the flourishing of arts and culture--the Bolsheviks reinstated strict censorship laws (most or all newspapers were taken under the control of the government, even those not opposing it) (47-49)
- by the 1930s even publications supporting the Bolshevik government were under control of the state (49)
- First Five Year Plan (1928-1933): collectivization, government control of all land, end to private land ownership and farming (51)

[*Early Provincial Cliques and the Rise of Stalin*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/151472)

- major factors in Stalin's rise to dominance: his ability to build up a substantial following in his party, skill at the tactical power game, and ability to project policies in the interests of wide circles of the party (3)
- patronage/clientelist relationships were prominent in the soviet government--significant aspect of the government that stalin inherited (4-5)
    - Lenin appointed two former close advisors V. D. Bonch-Bruevich his Head of Chancery and L. A. Fotieva his principle secretary (6)
    - Party secretary Sverdlov appointed his wife K. T. Novgorodtseva as one of his principal assistants (7)
    - Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya was the Deputy People's Commissar of Education, his sister Anna also represented the Education Commissariat, and his brother-in-law M. T. Elizarov was Acting People's Commissar of Railways (7)
- patronage was exposed to an extent by Stalin himself in his speech to the February-March 1937 plenum of the Central Committee (5)

[*Stalin*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/148505)

- Because he was from Georgia instead of Russia, he couldn't be accused of simply having strong patriotism when he described his desire to centralize (3-4)
- Stalin was intelligent and skilled in manipulation, political affairs, bargaining, and expressing himself (4)

[*Stalin's Revolution Reconsidered*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2495961.pdf?acceptTC=true)

- While western historians and even some Soviet historians up until Khrushchev's de-Stalinization campaigns believed that Stalin's regime was in fact a continuation of Bolshevism-Leninism, this supposed ideology should be challenged. (264)
- An early draft of the five-year plan proposed by Stalin in 1928 was already critiqued by fellow Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin as "adventurism" and the "policies of a madmen". He expected it to lead to overinvestment, supply crises, bottlenecks, constricting, declining industrial growth, and basically the economy that the Soviet Union ended up having under this plan. (265)
- Soviet historians and economics today have mostly agreed on Bukharin's ideals, having a modernized and industrialized society. "Without Stalin we undoubtedly could have attained much greater success." ---a Stalin dissident historian during his implementation of the plan. (265)
- In 1927 the Bolsheviks decided to protect the crisis free system they currently had in place and which Stalin was proposing to abandon. A year later his "revolution from above" would turn this on its head with the five year plan. (266) *Revolution from above is in contrast against revolutions typically driven by the lower/peasant classes.

*A Brief History of Russia*---Chapter 7: Soviet Russia: Utopian Dreams and Dystopian Realities (1917-1953)

- Following February Revolution, new leaders were still from mid-upper classes and hoped to maintain a *constitutional monarchy*, REVOLUTION IS OVER.
- Bolsheviks rejected capitalism and parliamentary democracy for being a tool of the bourgeoisie. Differed from other socialist groups following the Feb. Revolution by being unwilling to wait to achieve goals. Immediately set up indispensable leader in Vladimir Lenin and party with Bolsheviks.
- 1917 Provisional government created on March 15, Prime Minister Pavel Milyukov and Justice Minister Aleksandr Kerensky.
- Provisional government represented only the interests of a tiny upper crust of Russian society, of minimal influence with peasants.
- The Soviet "Order Number 1" instructed any military personnel in/around Petrograd to choose representatives to the Soviet and only obey the Soviets. Provis. Gov't could not challenge, and was left without a military after czarist police dissolved. (This stuff is between Feb and Oct Revolutions)
- The party we're talking about is Stalin's COMMUNIST PARTY: NOT BOLSHEVIKS, MENSHEVIKS, OR SOCIALISTS. Others may be relevant but they're not the central focus.
- Provincial gov't acceptance of German money in WWI helped gov't rally soldiers to put down uprisings and unrest post-February (March). (155)
- Lenin's plotting throughout the above time frame caused recruitment of Leon Trotsky and preparation for the October (November 7) Revolution. Conditions for workers and soldiers in and around Petrograd declined, allowed for Bolshevik recruitment. (156)
- March 1918 Bolsheviks sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, peace established.
- Decree of Land: abolish all private property ownership of land and force transfer to the peasantry. PROBLEMATIC FOR MOST RUSSIANS: Bolsheviks announce Council of People's Commissars/Sovnarkom to be new government, including ONLY Bolsheviks. Seemed to reflect exchanging the "czarist autocracy for another form of dictatorship" (158) 1917 shortly after OR
- Bolsheviks banned nonsocialist press, fought and won control of Russia's major cities (Moscow after 10 days of hard fighting), set up revolutionary tribunals to suppress opponents of the regime, outlawed the Cadet (Constitutional Democracy) Party, and raised the secret police again under the name Cheka (Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counterrevolution and Sabotage). (158)
- Opposition to regime grew quickly, especially after Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. SR's and even Left-SRs (which were brought into government briefly but had 0 voice) began clashes along with Mensheviks, Cadets, and others with varying beliefs. They became known as the Whites as opposed to the Bolshevik Reds.
- Split into 18 governments and factions, the Whites suffered from serious disadvantages even with aid from the Allies in 1918 who brought supplies and troops to their side. Also, Bolsheviks controlled the center of the country with main cities and industrial centers, while Whites were operating from the periphery and split by huge distances. (160)
- The Cheka went around mobilizing resources for the war effort, stopping at nothing to acquire arms, food, and goods. They formed "Committees of the Poor", waging class warfare in the villages and seizing food from prosperous peasants (aka Kulaks). "Food Requisition Detachments" armed with machine guns took anything the regime wanted from the peasantry. (160).
- In December 1922, Lenin suffered a second stroke and composed his "Testament", evaluating his top lieutenants and successors. Strongly urged for a collective leadership rather than a sole authority as he led, but preferred Leon Trotsky the outstanding member of the current politburo. January 1923 postscript added to urge Stalin be removed from his position as general secretary, "which Lenin understood was the key source of Stalin's growing power." In March he urged Trotsky to take the offensive against Stalin at 12th Party Congress---he did not follow through. (167)
- 1929 is the year Stalin consolidated his power, and 1953 is when he died. The Soviet gov't was directly responsible for the deaths of 10-20 million citizens, and millions more barely survived in the conditions that killed the others such as forced labor and collectivization. (167)
- 1923 succession struggle----while Trotsky seemed the logical successor and had great experience from leadership in November coup and Civil War, he paid no attention to placing supporters within the party. Stalin at this time, was one of the six members of the Politburo, and had credentials as General Secretary and other posts as well. (167)
