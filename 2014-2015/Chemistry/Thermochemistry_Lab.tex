    \section{Abstract}
        \subsection{Purpose}
            Using the reactants listed in the materials, determine the \(\Delta H_{rxn}\)
            for the reaction that occurs when these reactants are mixed:
            \[\ce{NH4Cl}_{(aq)}+\ce{NaOH}_{(aq)}\to\ce{NH3}_{(aq)}+\ce{NaCl}_{(aq)}+\ce{H2O}_{(l)}\]
        \subsection{Materials}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \SI{50}{\ml} \SI{2.0}{\Molar} \(\ce{NH3}_{(aq)}\)
                \item \SI{100}{\ml} \SI{2.0}{\Molar} \(\ce{HCl}_{(aq)}\)
                \item \SI{50}{\ml} \SI{2.0}{\Molar} \(\ce{NaOH}_{(aq)}\)
                \item \SI{50}{\ml} Graduated Cylinder
                \item Calorimeter and Lid
                \item Deionized/Distilled \(\ce{H2O}_{(l)}\)
                \item Thermometer
            \end{itemize}
    \section{Model}
        \[\ce{NH4Cl}_{(aq)}+\ce{NaOH}_{(aq)}\]
        \hrulefill
        \[\ce{HCl}_{(aq)}+\ce{NaOH}_{(aq)}\to\ce{NaCl}_{(aq)}+\ce{H2O}_{(l)}\]
        \dotfill
        \[\ce{NH3}_{(aq)}+\ce{HCl}_{(aq)}\to\ce{NH4Cl}_{(aq)}\]
        \[\ce{NH4Cl}_{(aq)}\to\ce{NH3}_{(aq)}+\ce{HCl}_{(aq)}\]
        \hrulefill
        \[\ce{NH4Cl}_{(aq)}+\ce{NaOH}_{(aq)}+\ce{HCl}_{(aq)}\to\ce{NH3}_{(aq)}+\ce{NaCl}_{(aq)}+\ce{H2O}_{(l)}+\ce{HCl}_{(aq)}\]
        \[\ce{NH4Cl}_{(aq)}+\ce{NaOH}_{(aq)}\to\ce{NH3}_{(aq)}+\ce{NaCl}_{(aq)}+\ce{H2O}_{(l)}\]
    \section{Data}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \(\ce{HCl}_{(aq)}+\ce{NaOH}_{(aq)}\to\ce{NaCl}_{(aq)}+\ce{H2O}_{(l)}\)
                has a \(\Delta H_{f}\) of \SI{-94.98}{\kJ\per\mol}
            \item \(\ce{NH4Cl}_{(aq)}\to\ce{NH3}_{(aq)}+\ce{HCl}_{(aq)}\) has a
                \(\Delta H_{f}\) of \SI{52.80}{\kJ\per\mol}
        \end{itemize}
        Adding \SI{-94.98}{\kJ\per\mol} and \SI{52.80}{\kJ\per\mol} gives a total
        enthalpy of reaction of \SI{-42.18}{\kJ\per\mol}
        \[\Delta H_{rxn} = \Delta H_{f_{1}} + \Delta H_{f_{2}}\]
    \section{Conclusion}
        Adding the two reactions above yields the proper equation for the reaction.
        Thus, adding the respective \(\Delta H_{f}\) of the two reactions is equivalent
        to the \(\Delta H_{rxn}\) of \(\ce{NH4Cl}_{(aq)}+\ce{NaOH}_{(aq)}\to\ce{NH3}_{(aq)}+\ce{NaCl}_{(aq)}+\ce{H2O}_{(l)}\)
